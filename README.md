## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonas, a Full Stack Developer, currently based in Barcelona, Spain ðŸŒž

I'm a Full Stack Developer, currently working on prejects independently. In a former life I was customer service representative and Chef, so I'm especially passionate about writing clean and neat code.

### What I'm doing now

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with a team on a project using **Angular** and **Typescript** and at the same time
trying to work on improving my SkateBuddy mobile app which is build on React Native using Expo, by adding extra features and keeping the clean code structure.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about mobile development with React Native and Expo.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
