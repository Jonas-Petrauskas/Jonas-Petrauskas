## Hi there 👋, I'm Jonas, a Full Stack Developer, currently based in Barcelona, Spain 🌞

I'm a Full Stack Developer, currently working on prejects independently. <br>
In a former life I was customer service representative and Chef 👨‍🍳,  so I'm especially passionate about writing clean and neat code.


## What I'm doing now

- 📌 Currently working with a team on a project [@DevStack](https://github.com/DevStack-LTD), using **Angular** and **Typescript**.<br>At the same time trying to work on improving my [@SkateBuddy](https://github.com/Jonas-Petrauskas/Skate-Buddy) mobile app which is build on React Native using Expo.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.

### Hobbies

- During my free time you can find me hitting streets with my Skateboard or cooking different types of food.
